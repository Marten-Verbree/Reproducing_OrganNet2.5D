# Reproducing_OrganNet2.5D

Our goal is to figure out how reproducible papers are. In this case, we will attempt to reproduce OrganNet2.5D as implemented by Z. Chen et al [1]. A preprocessed version of the Miccai dataset was obtained from Prerak Mody [2]. 
The original code is written on Google Colab. Thus, we recommend to run the code there.

We would like to thank Prerak Mody and Godwin R. Chandran for their guidance during the project and for fruitful meetings.
